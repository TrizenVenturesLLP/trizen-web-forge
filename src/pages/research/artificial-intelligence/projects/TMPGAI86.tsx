  title: "Brain Disease Classification & Brain Age Estimation Using CNN",
  objective: "Brain disease like Alzheimer, Mild Cognitive and Healthy Control is classified using deep learning CNN technique and brain age is estimated based on classified output. Finally output accuracy is compared with SVM machine learning technique.",
  abstract: `Here, brain disease classification and brain age are estimated using convolutional neural networks. Brain morphometric pattern analysis has been increasingly investigated to identify age-related imaging biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Compared with other biomedical image modalities, MRI is a non-invasive means of potentially identifying abnormal structural brain changes in a more sensitive manner.

Abnormality/normality like Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Healthy Control (HC) were classified using brain MRI images. Accuracy of traditional method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is analyzed, implemented and compared with the novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is of deep learning technique. After these`,
